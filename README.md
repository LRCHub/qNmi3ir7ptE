[02:30.80] I never ever ever want for us to be apart
[02:33.40] That's a fear, puppeteer, pulling strings to my heart
[02:36.21] Very serious, severely sitting here inside the dark
[02:38.92] 'Cause whenever you depart or disappear, I feel parched
[03:06.42] 
[02:42.42] All around the world, I wonder where you are
[02:44.40] What you doing? Who you hanging with? Probably with the stars
[02:47.29] At the party, you the main event, they the undercard
[02:50.06] Life changing, let 'em take a sip, they be back tomorrow
[03:18.06] 
[02:52.76] Shame shame, I'm still hanging with the same and lane changing in the Range
[02:56.14] The black seats, cream guts, 'bout to spill my drink
[02:58.81] Gas station, fill my tank, rolling, rolling, candy paint
[03:01.77] Right inside the cup holder, tryna ignore the phone ringing
[03:31.27] 
[03:04.41] JID the Buffalo soldier, my momma told me about the game
[03:07.12] Never cared about the fame, but now the whole world know my name
[03:09.94] Now I'm off the road, I made my quota, no, we ain't the same
[03:12.94] If you ain't notice, chilling really, but who the coldest
[03:41.44] 
[03:15.61] 코카콜라 맛있다 (uh)
[03:18.45] 코카콜라 맛있다 (yeah)
[03:20.98] See you looking, catch it

[03:26.89] 코카콜라 맛있다 (yeah)
[03:29.42] 코카콜라 맛있다 (yeah)
[03:32.06] See you looking, catch it
[03:33.77] Here's your Cola (yeah)
[03:35.05] See you looking, catch it
[03:36.46] Here's your Cola-la-la-la (uh)
